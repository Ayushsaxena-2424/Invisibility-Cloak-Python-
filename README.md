Invisibility Cloak(Python)


Here, we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. In order to run this code, you need an mp4 video named “video.mp4“. You must have a cloth of same color and no other color should be visible into that cloth. We are taking the red cloth. If you are taking some other cloth, the code will remain the same but with minute changes.
